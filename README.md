# technotrack-NN
#### Repository with my homeworks done during studies on TechnoTrack Neural Networks course

## Implemented tasks
- ### [Linear Regression class-based model with Vanilla SGD](task_01/HW01.ipynb)
This task contains realization of classic linear regression fully on `NumPy` and almost providing `PyTorch` interface.

- ### [Fully connected NN with SGD+Momentum](task_02/HW02.ipynb)
Realization of fully connected neural network for `MNIST` classification with stochastic gradient descent and Momentum as an optimization method. Also used only `NumPy` as a backend and model has a `Sequential` interface of `Pytorch`.
